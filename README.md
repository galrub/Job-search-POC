This is s demo project to improve my skills in GoLang and Docker,
In order for it to work there is a need to create two Docker secrets and two networks.

Secrets:
- postgres_password
- jobsearch_password

Networks:
- jobsearch_frontend
- jobsearch_backend

Deployment on the docker stack is a bit funky but works, definitly requires some more work, but the principle important of this repo is 
to demostrate some Golang skills, and for me, to get a more indept experience with actual coding.
